# crowd-funding-demo
This is a Crowd Funding Project based on Java. It uses SSM (Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud+ Mybatis) and features basic CRUD, log-in, log-out, authority control, third party API etc. However, this project is still in progress, with some of the functions untested.

For introduction and technical details, please refer to the file: Java-众筹项目.pdf

For the source code, please refer to: crowd-funding-src.rar.
